## Features

1. Dynamic Data Integration
    Dynamic Product Data: The website uses dynamic data for products, fetched from either third-party APIs or custom-built APIs.
    Individual Product Page: Clicking on a product card on the homepage will navigate users to a detailed individual product page.
2. Individual Product Page
    Size Selection: Users can select sizes (XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL) for products that are in stock. The size options are disabled for out-of-stock products.
    Wishlist Functionality:
      Users can add or remove products to/from their wishlist, regardless of stock status.
      Wishlist status is maintained across the homepage and individual product pages.
    Add to Cart:
      Users can add products to their cart. If the product is already in the cart, the quantity will be increased.
      The "Add to Cart" button transforms into a "Go to Cart" button after the product is added.
      The "Go to Cart" button navigates users to the cart page.
      The button is disabled for out-of-stock products.
3. Cart Page
      Cart Navigation: Clicking the cart icon in the navbar navigates to the cart page.
    Remove from Cart:
      Clicking "Remove from Cart" triggers a pop-up confirmation with "Yes" and "No" options.
      Selecting "Yes" removes the product; selecting "No" retains the current quantity.
      If quantity becomes zero, a confirmation pop-up asks whether to remove the item.
    Quantity Management: Users can increase or decrease the quantity of products in their cart. The total amount updates accordingly.
    Order Now:
     Clicking "Order Now" displays a toast message with the total amount and a thank you message.
     The cart is cleared after placing an order.
      If the cart is empty, a message saying "Your cart feels very light! ðŸ¥º" is shown.
